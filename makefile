# reldreds garbage nfo compile system
# Written by reldred, the artist formerly known as Aegir. Major kudos to Josef 'Patchman' Drexler for the 
# suggestion to abuse the hell out of gcc preprocess and then make nforenum wipe our arses for us.

# Have fun.

# Our Steps:
# 1: gcc -ECP preprocess
# 2: nforenum process
# 3: grfcodec compile

# Macros:
# Paths for our tools
NMLC = nmlc
GRFDIR = ../../../../Software/Games/JGR\ Patchpack/newgrf/

# GCC Settings:
CC = gcc
PREPROCESS = -nostdinc -E -C -P - <

# Aliases for the set:
NAME = re_foars

# Now, the fun stuff:

# Target for all:
all : compile

# Compile GRF's
#don't need graphics anymore since grfcodec can eat pngs
